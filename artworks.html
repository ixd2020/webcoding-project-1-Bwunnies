    <h1 id="effiel">His Eiffel Tower Series</h1>
    
    Robert Delaunay is best known for his paintings the Eiffel Tower Series. He painted the first series between 1909 and 1912 and a second series between 1920 and 1930. In the second series Delaunay paints in a style known as Orphic Cubism, where color is used to envision form through planes and lines of contrasting colors. As Delaunay wrote in his journal, the Eiffel Tower was the “barometer of [his] art,” a symbol of Paris and its success as a modern haven. Delaunay saw the Eiffel Tower as the pride of France as the country stepped boldly into the modern age. Like other artists that relayed their urban experiences by painting cityscapes, Delaunay used the structure as a template upon which he conveyed his imagined visions and perceptions of Paris. Unlike the German Expressionists’ typically chaotic and dark paintings of urban scenes, Delaunay’s post-war Eiffel Tower series celebrates the enthusiastic feeling for progress that the modern metropolis would allow. By 1924 Paris was a center of innovation and recreating the Eiffel Tower as he imagined it allowed Delaunay to communicate his own optimism for modern life.

    <h1 id="windows">His Window Series</h1>
    
    In his Windows series, a group of twenty-two paintings made between April and December of 1912, Delaunay rejected painting’s traditional function as a window onto an imaginary world. Instead he turned to the pictorial surface as a place where the process of seeing itself could be recorded. “Without visual perception there is no light, no movement,” Delaunay wrote in the summer of 1912. “This movement is provided by relationships of uneven measures, by color contrasts, which constitute Reality.” Light and its structuring of vision, the simultaneous contrasts of colors and their steady rhythmic motion, became the subjects of Delaunay’s Windows, setting the stage for his move into abstraction. “The Windows,” he wrote, “truly began my life as an artist.”

    <h1 id="circle"> His Circular and Rythme Series</h1>
      
    Robert Delaunay chose the view into the ambulatory of the Parisian Gothic church Saint-Séverin as the subject of his first series of paintings, in which he charted the modulations of light streaming through the stained-glass windows and the resulting perceptual distortion of the architecture. The subdued palette and the patches of color that fracture the smooth surface of the floor point to the influence of Paul Cézanne as well as to the stylistic elements of Georges Braque’s early Cubist landscapes. Delaunay said that the Saint-Séverin theme in his work marked “a period of transition from Cézanne to Cubism.”
